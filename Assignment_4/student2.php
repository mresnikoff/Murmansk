		<p>I'm a computer science major at the University of Rochester. My area of study is focused in Human-computer Interaction, ties in my interest in learning how design can make or break a product. 

		 Being brought up in Mumbai, India, has been a different experience of life as compared to that of Rochester. Mumbai is the capital city of Maharashtra & also the financial capital of India. A little-known fact, Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay. Mumbai is that part of India which works 24X7 and never sleeps. Marathi is the local language, but still, Hindi and English are also spoken fluently. Which is the reason why people traveling from various parts of the world not faces any kind of language constraints in Mumbai like other cities in India, making it a popular tourist spot for people located in various parts of the world. Another reason for having a number of visitors is due to Mumbai being the home to Bollywood, the second largest film industry in the world, right after Hollywood. In regards to the climate, the temperature in the city varies throughout the year. March to June are the summer months having a maximum temperature of around 40 degrees. June to October are the monsoon months with rain in its full force. November to February are the months of winter. Winters are mild in Mumbai because it is situated in the coastal region but the weather remains pleasant. An extensive network of these trains runs throughout the city- Harbor line, Central line and the Western line.</p>

		<h2>Comp Sci Work Experience</h2>
		<div class="one">
			<p>I am looking to explore entrepreneurship from multiple aspects, being hands-on, developing a product and meanwhile also looking for disruptive tech as a venture capitalist. Having the experience being both a hands-on technical developer at multiple startups and a business analyst for Deloitte’s technology branch, I’ve had the opportunity to see where my interests lie. The skills to be a successful product manager resonate with what I do as a student on campus, running the entrepreneurship club, being on the Senate and being part of a student VC firm are all such examples. These experiences have taught me to handle multiple projects simultaneously and work with teams delegating tasks. My experience at Deloitte was the extra push that I needed to figure out that this is my calling, a lot of what I did there was working with workflows and setting project guidelines. I also worked with the director of Product & Customer Insights in creating a roadmap for an upcoming project, having had this professional experience on working on managing projects for Deloitte, I think I would do a great job as a product manager in the near future. Having a passion for entrepreneurship, in August of 2016 I had an idea to start an organization that helps students to make successful ventures and has an open forum to talk about the things people want to create. Till date I believe understanding the problem is the first step to solving it. Every venture is a problem you’re trying to solve in the world, let's say television is trying to solve the problem of boredom and Google is solving the problem of finding information. With this motivation I began to find a team to get the club rolling, that's when I came across tons of peers interested in the concept of startups. From there originated a club UR Incubators, async with our mission to incubate ventures, giving them an idea of what they are trying to accomplish and helping them solve issues they face. The concept seemed like a big seller on paper, but we faced many issues bringing this to life including competition from another perspective organization MORE, that planned to preach about entrepreneurship from a curriculum based system that would use books as the main form of learning. This made us rethink what UR incubator is trying to achieve, giving us 4 months of meetings with club advisors, departments and the Administration and Review committee. These meetings ended up being crucial to the organizations success, being critiqued on various outlooks of the organization from people from different backgrounds give us a ton of feedback to work with. We moved from helping people better their ventures to raising awareness of entrepreneurship to help people learn what entrepreneurship is for them. Along with this came a huge rebrand of the organization, Meliora LaunchPad became the new entrepreneurial club on campus talking on the issue of showing students the importance of entrepreneurship and how its applicable in life. While not many people have heard of any existence of MORE. Since the August of 2016 we’ve come along way from having a problem to creating a solution to the problem, and this is what we do at Meliora LaunchPad, innovate to success. If you ask me what have I learned throughout the process, it would have to be to think of why you’re solving the problem that you’re solving, if you don’t have the answer you’ll keep wandering with whatever it is that you’re doing. Have a reason. Learn from others mistakes. Ask the right questions. Make it happen. </p>

		<h2>Interests & Hobbies involving Comp Sci</h2>
		<div class="two">
		
			<p>I enjoy reading technology news and researching about technological advancements in various fields, which ties into my area of study, HCI.

		Through the course of my college career I worked on various projects, but one in particular struck out, Gesture Link db, a project I worked on for my HCI class is a device that recognizes sounds made by different gestures which are then classified to do tasks. The purpose of creating gesture link was to help the handicapped and elderly to be able to control technology without having to go through the complicated setup process and controls. We approached the design to be simplistic and user friendly, gesture link uses python to classify different sounds, sources the numbers of highs in the frequency curve and does a resulting action. For the prototype we used a pair of standard apple microphone as the sound receiver and hosted a website to showcase the project with demos of dimming lights and turning them on/off. This is just one aspect of the endless possible actions gesture link can perform to help make technology easier for everyone.
