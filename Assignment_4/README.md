City Name- Murmansk, IA-Matt Resnikoff, Coder- Albert Nissim, Designer- Oliver Ostriker

Reasoning for Ontology- In class it was brought up that a big problem with assignment 3 was all the useless information being presented outside from the three students similarities. In this assignment, I was sure to focus in on the similarities (comp sci majors) and the information that came with it, as well as focus in on Olivers financial econ major and the info that came with it.

Reasoning for Choreography- I structured it similarly to the past teams IA, having each persons page start with background info and a picture, and then focusing in more on the comp sci major aspect in the next two sections, work experiance and hobbies involving comp sci (and for oliver, financial econ).

Taxonomy explanation- I shorten computer science to comp sci often throughout to make things a bit better looking, I also refer to financial econ as fin econ at one point for the same reason, long words don't look great if they make the headlines too long.

Layout- This'll be similar to the previous IA's layout, first section should have image in top right corner, the other two sections should have a header with a big blocky font and scroly info.

Typeface/Fonts - All headers should have big blocky font, the information that follows should be smaller and scriptier but still somewhat blocky to go with the header. The previous IA used a good custom font we can use. Should be consistent throughout.

Form- First asks for the users name in a small textbox. Then asks for input about who had the most interesting background. Since the first three are all similar, the obvious choice should be Oliver, but since he's a fin econ major it should be fun to see how many find that "interesting". Layout has a multiple choice form with radio buttons asking who had the most interesting background, and then an open textbox forum where the user can explain why.

Color Choices, Borders/Edges, Etc.: The IA and I (Oliver) wanted the site to have a sleek and modern feel to it, so this was the main basis for my color choices. We believed that computer science and finance both match up well with the sleek Throughout the pages, the text was highlighted by either copper or silver/gray, and the top bar highlighted brown when scrolled over, and teal when the page is selected. This, along with the white background for the whole page and gray, black, and white font colors I believed gave off the feel we were looking for quite perfectly.

CRAP:

Contrast- For contrast, I wanted to include color borders and edges that would stick out on the white background, but would not come off as too loud as to continue going along with the modern and sleek feel that we wanted. My use of the black font on the grey background I felt portrayed this perfectly, as it allowed the text to be very readable, but at the same time not to be obnoxious and in your face. At the same time, on the front page I used the copper background for the site description as I wanted it to stick out more so than any other text on the page because I felt that it was the most important aspect of the home page.

Repition- For repition, I made sure that all of the student pages were designed the same way as to make sure every page looked as if it belonged to the same site. At the same time, I used a similar color scheme and layout for the home and feedback pages for this same purpose. Overall, I believe that my use of repition does a great job of making sure the site is unified throughout.

Allignment- For allignment, I made sure to space all of the text and images well throughout the pages to make sure that items were well lined up with eachother. I wanted the reader's eye to be caught right away by the important information, and I wanted to avoid any awkward placement that would come off as confusing or cluttered. I also made sure to repeat a similar allignment throughout the site.

Proximity- For proximity, I made sure to have text boxes closely alligned with the headlines that they should be matched with in order to make it clear that they have a relationship. All items that are grouped together are grouped together for a purpose, and I believe that I did a good job of making sure items with a relationship are clearly grouped with eachother.

Fonts: Throughout the site, I decided to stick with the fonts that were incorporated by the bootstrap plug-in that was used, as I felt they portrayed the mood of the site as well as I would have wanted. For the headers, the font-family inherit was used. This font was simple and did a good job of catching the reader's eyes so that they could very easily know where to look to find the information they are interested in. For the body, the font family Helvetica Neue was used, which I believe works well as it is less loud than the headers, but still comes off as very sleek and modern. Having the words in all caps adds to this feeling as well. This same font is used for the copyright on the bottom of the pages, and the bar on the top of the home page. 

Layout Implementations: For the display throughout, we used CSS Flex in order to portray all items in an organized manner. I believe that using the flex option was necessary to display our allignment and proximity just as we wanted. And again, the flex option compliments the modern and sleek feel we wanted to help give off the professional feeling behind computer science and finance majors.
