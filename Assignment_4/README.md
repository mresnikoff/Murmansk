City Name- Murmansk, IA-Matt Resnikoff, Coder- Albert Nissim, Designer- Oliver Ostriker

Reasoning for Ontology- In class it was brought up that a big problem with assignment 3 was all the useless information being presented outside from the three students similarities. In this assignment, I was sure to focus in on the similarities (comp sci majors) and the information that came with it, as well as focus in on Olivers financial econ major and the info that came with it.

Reasoning for Choreography- I structured it similarly to the past teams IA, having each persons page start with background info and a picture, and then focusing in more on the comp sci major aspect in the next two sections, work experiance and hobbies involving comp sci (and for oliver, financial econ).

Taxonomy explanation- I shorten computer science to comp sci often throughout to make things a bit better looking, I also refer to financial econ as fin econ at one point for the same reason, long words don't look great if they make the headlines too long.

Layout- This'll be similar to the previous IA's layout, first section should have image in top right corner, the other two sections should have a header with a big blocky font and scroly info.

Typeface/Fonts - All headers should have big blocky font, the information that follows should be smaller and scriptier but still somewhat blocky to go with the header. The previous IA used a good custom font we can use. Should be consistent throughout.

Form- Asks for input about who had the most interesting background. Since the first three are all similar, the obvious choice should be Oliver, but since he's a fin econ major it should be fun to see how many find that "interesting". Layout has a multiple choice form with radio buttons asking who had the most interesting background, and then an open textbox forum where the user can explain why.
