		<p>
			My name is Oliver Ostriker and I am a junior at the University of Rochester majoring in Financial Economics with minors in both Business and Computer Science. I am originally from Greenwich, Connecticut where I attended Greenwich High School. In High School, I really enjoyed an AP Economics course that I took, and therefore decided I wanted to major in something economics related. Because of this, I came across the University of Rochester which happened to have an incredible economics program. In addition, I had an uncle who lived in Rochester and a sister attending the school, so overall the U of R seemed like a great fit. Originally I had planned to major in just straight economics, but after taking a financial accounting course and finding how much I enjoyed it, I decided that the financial economics major that the school offered worked best for me. I also decided than careerwise, I would like to work within the finance industry.

		<h2>Financial Econ Work Experience</h2>
		<div class="one">

<p>This past summer I completed an internship at Skyview Ventures LLC, a renewable energy finance, development and asset management company. At Skyview Ventures, I had the opportunity to learn about the solar market through research and analysis into government policies that affect the supply and demand of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). This experience helped me develop research and analytical skills as well as interpersonal and communication skills necessary to present my findings to the senior staff and president of the firm. I spent my time at the office working in a fast-paced trading environment, and learned to pay great attention to detail, deliver work quickly and consistently, and obtained trust from the senior staff in my ability to deliver and solve problems on my own. As a result of this experience, I have been able to develop stronger problem-solving skills while growing my knowledge of finance and the solar market. In addition, I assisted in day-to-day activities such as reviewing trade agreements for SRECs and inputting them into the Skyview trading software, generating and sending out invoices to buyers and managing our company’s accounts payable and receivable through the use of spreadsheets and the company’s bank statements. I also attended a solar summit at John Jay College where innovations in the solar and solar storage markets were discussed and presented findings to the president and senior staff. </p>

		<h2>Financial Econ Coursework and Interests</h2>
		<div class="two">
		<p>
			At school, I have taken Elements of Probability and Statistics, Introduction to Debate, Introduction to Economics, Freshman Writing, Reporting and Writing the News, Honors Intermediate Microeconomics, Financial Accounting, Web Design and Development, Feature Writing, Intermediate Macroeconomics, Managerial Accounting, Financial Management, Economic Theory of Organizations, Introduction to Anthropology, Introduction to Python, Creative Computing, Business Law, Introduction to Psychology, and Economics of Sports. I am also working as a Teaching Assistant this semester for Economics of Sports. Outside of school, I am a huge sports fan, and particularly have an interest in basketball. I love playing pick-up and intramural basketball whenever I have free time, and I am a huge fan of the Boston Celtics. I became a Celtics fan in 2003, when my favorite player in Backyard Basketball was Paul Pierce (the Celtics star small forward). From there, I asked for a Paul Pierce jersey for my 7th birthday and wore it to school almost every day in 1st grade. From there, the rest has been history.
